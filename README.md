                               PROJECT 1: Predicting Customer Churn for Subscription Services

Objective:
The goal of this project was to predict customer churn for a subscription service using historical customer data. The objective was to identify customers who are likely to leave the service, allowing businesses to take proactive actions to improve retention rates.

Key Findings:
Feature Importance: Key factors influencing customer churn included subscription type, service usage, and customer support interaction.
Model Performance: The Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved an accuracy of 85-90%, demonstrating strong predictive power.
Churn Insights: Customers with low engagement and frequent billing issues were more likely to churn.
Actionable Insights: The model's predictions can help businesses target at-risk customers with tailored retention strategies such as discounts or upgrades.

Tools Used:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries:
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation
XGBoost for gradient boosting
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

                                       PROJECT 2: Iris Flower Classification

Objective:
The goal of this project was to classify Iris flower species based on their physical features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The objective was to apply machine learning techniques to accurately predict the species of Iris flowers from the given dataset.

Key Findings:
Model Performance: The Decision Tree Classifier achieved high accuracy in classifying the Iris species, with an accuracy of approximately 98%.
Key Features: Petal length and petal width were the most significant features influencing the classification of Iris flowers.
Classification Insights: The dataset's balanced nature and distinct species characteristics helped the model perform well across all species.
Confusion Matrix: The model showed minimal misclassification across the three Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).

Tools Used:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries:
Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and plotting
Pandas for data manipulation.
